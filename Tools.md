## F. Cloud Computing

Cloud computing offers a plethora of benefits, including scalability, accessibility to vast computational resources, and specialized services tailored for AI development and deployment. This guide aims to provide AI engineers with a comprehensive overview of essential cloud computing concepts and practices.

### 1 - Define IAM for Your Organization

As an AI engineer embarks on their cloud journey, one of the foundational steps is to establish Identity and Access Management (IAM). IAM allows administrators to authorize specific actions on resources, enabling centralized control and visibility over cloud resources.

- Azure: [Azure IAM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/product-categories/identity/)
- AWS: [AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)
- GCP: [GCP IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam)

###  2 - Define a Network or VPC for Each Region or Site

VPC defines subnets, gateways, and DNS settings. This is needed before VM instances and Load balancing instance. There is no additional charge for using Virtual Private Cloud, aside from the normal VM usage charges. But there is a charge if connecting Own VPN toyour VPC. A VPC is need before a load-balancer, EC2 instances, and other cloud resources.

###  3 - Define Availability Zones or Rack

An availability zone is a logical data center in a region available for use. Each zone in a region has redundant and separate power, networking and connectivity to reduce the likelihood of two zones failing simultaneously. A common misconception is that a single zone equals a single data center.

###  4 - Load-Balance Your Availability Zones

- Use ELB to load balance availability zones inside a VPC.

###  5 - Control Access to Each VPC 

- Use Security groups to control access to computing instances. This is stateful: return traffic automatically allowed, regardless of any rules.
- Use network ACLs to control access to subnets. This is stateless: return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules.

###  6 - Load-Balance Your VPCs

Deploying DNS-based load balancing solutions such as Route 53 (AWS), Traffic Manager (Azure), or Cloud DNS (GCP) enables efficient distribution of traffic across multiple geographical locations. This enhances the performance and availability of AI applications for users worldwide.

###  7 - Review Cloud Services for Each Provider

Each cloud provider offers a vast array of services spanning Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS). AI engineers should thoroughly review the documentation for each provider to leverage their offerings effectively.Examples of providers: 

- AWS Documentation: [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/)
- GCP Documentation: [GCP Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs)
- Azure Documentation: [Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/)
- Alibaba Cloud Documentation: [Alibaba Cloud Documentation](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help)


AI engineers must carefully evaluate cloud providers based on their specific requirements, including scalability, pricing models, support options, and security features. Selecting the right cloud provider is crucial for the success of AI projects and ensuring seamless integration with cloud-based AI services and tools.
