### Question 2:
**What role does data play in AI, as described in the text?**
- **A) It is the AI's favorite ingredient, essential for learning.**  
  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because the text compares data to ingredients in cooking, emphasizing its importance in making the AI "brighter" or more effective.
- B) It is optional for AI development.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; data is crucial, not optional, for AI.
- C) It is only needed in small amounts, regardless of the task.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; while smaller datasets can be useful, the text stresses the importance of data volume, variety, and velocity.
- D) It is the AI's output after processing.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; data is the input, not the output, for AI.

### Question 3:
**Which of the following is NOT one of the "3 Keys to Tasty Data"?**
- **A) Variety.**  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; variety is one of the keys mentioned in the text, important for providing multiple perspectives to the AI.
- **B) Velocity.**  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; velocity is also a key factor, referring to the speed at which data is available for AI to make decisions.
- **C) Volume.**  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; volume is another key, indicating that more data can help the AI find important patterns.
- D) Visualization.  
  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because visualization is not mentioned as one of the three keys in the text.

### Question 4:
**What is an algorithm's role in AI, according to the text?**
- **A) It's the AI's recipe book, guiding data processing.**  
  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because the text likens algorithms to recipes, providing instructions for how AI processes data.
- B) It replaces the need for data in AI.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; algorithms require data to function, as emphasized in the text.
- C) It is unnecessary if you have high-quality data.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; even with high-quality data, algorithms are essential for processing and making sense of that data.
- D) It acts as the final output of the AI system.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; algorithms guide the process, but they are not the final output.

### Question 5:
**Which of the following is an example of an AI application mentioned in the text?**
- **A) An AI that predicts customer favorites.**  
  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because the text explicitly mentions creating AI systems that predict customer preferences as one of the goals.
- B) An AI that only stores large amounts of data.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; storing data alone is not considered an AI application in the text.
- C) An AI that designs its own algorithms without data.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; designing algorithms requires data, and the text does not suggest AI can operate without it.
- D) An AI that does nothing.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; the text emphasizes that AI should have a clear application or goal, not just be inactive.

### Question 6:
**Which of the following best describes the concept of Explainable AI (XAI) as mentioned in the text?**
- **A) It helps users understand why AI makes certain decisions.**  
  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because the text explains XAI as a way to make AI decisions transparent and understandable, which builds trust and ensures compliance.
- B) It eliminates the need for data engineers.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; XAI is about explanation, not replacing the need for data engineers.
- C) It automatically improves AI's decision-making accuracy.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; XAI is focused on explaining decisions, not necessarily improving accuracy.
- D) It hides the decision-making process of AI for security reasons.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; XAI is the oppositeâ€”it reveals and clarifies the decision-making process.

### Question 7:
**Why is it important to match the algorithm to your data and project goal, as discussed in the text?**
- **A) To ensure that the AI performs effectively and meets the desired outcome.**  
  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because the text emphasizes that choosing the right algorithm is crucial for the AI to function properly and achieve the project's objectives.
- B) To reduce the cost of data collection.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; while cost might be a consideration, the primary focus is on the effectiveness of the AI.
- C) To avoid using any data at all.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; the text stresses the importance of data in conjunction with the right algorithm.
- D) To make the AI system as complex as possible.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; complexity for its own sake is not the goal, and the text highlights the importance of appropriateness rather than complexity.

### Question 8:
**What is the benefit of Explainable AI (XAI) in compliance with regulatory standards?**
- **A) It helps organizations prove that their AI systems are making fair and legal decisions.**  
  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because the text mentions that XAI is important for industries like healthcare and finance, where understanding and proving the fairness of AI decisions is critical.
- B) It automatically makes AI systems faster.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; XAI focuses on explanation, not speed.
- C) It reduces the need for human oversight.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; while XAI helps understand AI decisions, human oversight is still necessary.
- D) It removes the need for data in decision-making.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; data remains essential in AI, even with XAI.

  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because the text specifically mentions using no-code tools to perform regression tasks like predicting house prices.
- B) Writing an entire AI system from scratch.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; no-code tools are for simplifying tasks, not writing entire systems from scratch.
- C) Ignoring the need for data.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; data is still required, even with no-code tools.
- D) Making AI systems without any algorithms.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; algorithms are essential, and no-code tools provide ready-made algorithms.
