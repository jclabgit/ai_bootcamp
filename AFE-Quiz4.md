### Question 2:
**What type of data is used in supervised learning, as described in the text?**
- **A) Labeled Data.**  
  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because the text explains that supervised learning uses labeled data, where examples come with the correct answer.
- B) Unlabeled Data.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; unlabeled data is used in unsupervised learning, not supervised learning.
- C) Structured Data.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; while structured data can be used in supervised learning, the key characteristic is that it is labeled.
- D) Audio Recordings.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; audio recordings can be used as data, but the key aspect of supervised learning is that the data is labeled.

### Question 3:
**Which algorithm is best suited for a classification task, such as filtering emails into "spam" or "not spam"?**
- **A) Support Vector Machines (SVMs).**  
  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because the text mentions SVMs as one of the algorithms used for classification tasks like filtering spam.
- B) Linear Regression.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; linear regression is used for regression tasks, not classification.
- C) K-means.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; K-means is used for clustering, not classification.
- D) Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; GANs are used for generating data, not for classification tasks.

### Question 4:
**What is an example of an unsupervised learning task mentioned in the text?**
- **A) Clustering customers based on purchase history.**  
  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because the text uses clustering as an example of an unsupervised learning task where the AI groups customers based on similarities without predefined labels.
- B) Predicting house prices based on square footage.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; predicting house prices is a regression task in supervised learning.
- C) Filtering emails as "spam" or "not spam."  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; this is a classification task in supervised learning.
- D) Detecting tumors in medical images.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; detecting tumors can involve supervised learning with labeled data.

### Question 5:
**Which machine learning technique is best for simplifying high-dimensional data for faster processing?**
- **A) Dimensionality Reduction.**  
  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because the text describes dimensionality reduction as a technique used to simplify high-dimensional data, making it easier and faster to process.
- B) Clustering.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; clustering groups data points based on similarity, but doesn't necessarily reduce dimensionality.
- C) Reinforcement Learning.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; reinforcement learning involves learning through trial and error, not simplifying data.
- D) Regression.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; regression predicts outcomes based on input features but doesn't simplify data dimensions.

### Question 6:
**What is the primary goal of reinforcement learning, as explained in the text?**
- **A) Learning through trial and error to make decisions.**  
  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because the text describes reinforcement learning as a process where AI learns to make decisions by trying different actions and learning from the outcomes.
- B) Predicting future trends based on historical data.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; predicting trends is typically a regression task, not reinforcement learning.
- C) Clustering similar data points together.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; clustering is an unsupervised learning task, not reinforcement learning.
- D) Simplifying data for faster processing.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; simplifying data is related to dimensionality reduction, not reinforcement learning.

### Question 7:
**What is "overfitting" in the context of AI model training?**
- **A) When the AI memorizes the training data instead of learning general patterns.**  
  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because the text defines overfitting as a situation where the AI performs well on training data but fails on new data because it has memorized the training set rather than learning general patterns.
- B) When the AI is too simple and misses important patterns.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; this describes underfitting, not overfitting.
- C) When the AI performs equally well on training and new data.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; performing well on both indicates good generalization, not overfitting.
- D) When the AI uses too much computational power.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; overfitting relates to how the model learns, not the computational power it uses.

### Question 8:
**Which algorithm is recommended for image recognition tasks like recognizing cats in photos?**
- **A) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).**  
  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because the text mentions CNNs as being particularly strong in image recognition tasks, such as identifying cats in photos.
- B) Linear Regression.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; linear regression is used for predicting continuous values, not for image recognition.
- C) K-means.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; K-means is a clustering algorithm, not typically used for image recognition.
- D) Q-Learning.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; Q-Learning is used in reinforcement learning, not in image recognition.

### Question 9:
**What is the purpose of using a validation set during AI model training?**
- **A) To check if the AI can apply knowledge to new, unseen data.**  
  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because the text describes a validation set as a tool to test whether the AI can generalize its learning to new data, preventing overfitting.
- B) To train the AI on more data.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; a validation set is used to test, not train the AI.
- C) To increase the accuracy of the training data.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; the validation set checks the model's performance, not the accuracy of the training data.
- D) To evaluate the AI's speed.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; the validation set is used to assess the AI's ability to generalize, not its speed.

### Question 10:
**What is the role of human experts in machine learning, according to the text?**
- **A) They provide context, judgment, and ethical oversight.**  
  *Explanation:* This is the best answer because the text emphasizes that while AI handles data processing and pattern recognition, human experts are crucial for providing context, making judgments, and ensuring ethical use.
- B) They are unnecessary if the AI is powerful enough.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; the text highlights the importance of human input, even with advanced AI.
- C) They only monitor the AI without interacting with it.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; the text implies that human experts actively engage with AI, not just monitor it.
- D) They design physical robots for AI to control.  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect; while AI can control robots, the text focuses on the broader role of human experts in guiding AI's use and development.
